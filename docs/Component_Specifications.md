# Component Specification

This document will contain information about the following:
- **Software components**: High-level description of the software components such as data manager, which provides a simplified interface to your data and provides application-specific features (e.g., querying data subsets); and visualization manager, which displays data frames as a plot.
  - 3 components specifying what it does, inputs it requires, and outputs it provides. If you have more significant components in your system, we     highly suggest documenting those as well.
- **Interactions to accomplish use cases**: Describe how the above software components interact to accomplish your use cases.
  - one interaction diagram

## Use Case 1: TED Talk/ Podcast Recommendation System 

**Components:**
- User Interface to prompt YouTube video URL and selection options between summary and the recommendation system, and then between podcasts and TED Talks
- YouTube Video URL control logic to ensure it meets the specifications/
- Recommendation System control logic/
- User Interface for Recommendation System/

**Recommendation System Control Logic:**
- **Name**: Recommend
- **What it does**: It selects and shows the TED talks/ podcasts from our database that are most related to the provided YouTube video.
- **Inputs**: Takes the summary from the previous module (LLM Summarizer) 
- **Outputs**: A list of TED Talks and/or Podcasts that are relevant to the userâ€™s inputted YouTube Video
- **Assumptions**: The summary outputted from the LLM Summarizer is an accurate representation of the YouTube video
- **How it uses other component**s: The Recommendation module is connected to the LLM Summarizer because the recommendation algorithm will use the summary to generate a similarity score to find and display relevant TED talks and podcasts

The diagram below depicts the interactions of the Recommendation System.

## Use Case 2: YouTube Summarizer System

**Components**:
- User Interface to prompt YouTube video URL and get a summary button
- YouTube Video URL control logic to ensure the URL is valid and has subtitles
- Summarization control logic
- User Interface to show the summary

**Youtube Transcript Module**
- **Name**: processTranscripts
- **What it does**: Getting a YouTube URL to crawl the transcript from users, crawls the transcript, and displays the result
- **Input**: Youtube Video URL
- **Output**: Crawled YouTube Transcript
- **Assumptions**: The URL is valid, and the video has subtitles.
- **How it uses other components**: The output will be used for a summarization component through GPT API.

The diagram below depicts the interactions of the components in the YouTube Transcript Module.

**Summarization Module:**
**Name**: summarizeTranscripts
**What it does**: Creates a summary of a YouTube video Transcript
**Inputs**: Youtube Video Transcript
**Outputs**: Summary of YouTube video
**Assumptions**: The given transcript will be detailed enough to create a relevant summary, and GPT API has a valid key and quota.
**How it uses other components**: Uses the Youtube Transcript Component to obtain YouTube video Transcript to summarize
