Religion as a Moral Center,1,"October 3, 2006",Religion is not necessary for a good moral center.,Brian Dunning,Religion,"Dunning, B. ""Religion as a Moral Center."" Skeptoid Podcast. Skeptoid Media, 3 Oct 2006. Web. 3 Nov 2023. <https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4001>","Today we pull open the drawer in the motel bureau and face the need to have a	Moral Center, that core set of behaviors and ethics that governs the way we	conduct ourselves and live our lives.
Whatever your beliefs may be, I happen to be non-religious. I do not believe that	supernatural deities exist. There's nothing evil or wrong about that. I view	the  God of Abraham in the same way that the average Christian, Muslim, or Jew views Shiva, Athena,	or Odin. There's nothing evil or wrong about doubting the actual divinity	of those characters either. Yet a common generalization made by some religious	people is that the non-religious lack a Moral Center. More than once, in late night	bull sessions with religious friends, I've been told that faith is a necessary	component for developing a sound Moral Center. The implication is that religious	beliefs play an important role in the development of a normal, healthy system	of ethics and personal conduct. Without religious faith, one is less likely	to become a ""moral"" person. Thus, one of many reasons that people	of faith want to reach out to the non-religious is to help them to find	a Moral Center; both for their own good so that they can be saved, and for the good of society so they're not running around being immoral and unethical.
 My response to the religious people — after thanking them for the assumption	that I am an immoral person — is to compare our Moral Centers and see	where these supposed differences lie. If you knew me personally, you would	probably find me to be a generally upstanding person, like yourself, who stays	out of trouble, brushes his teeth, walks his kids to school, and tries not	to shout too much in the library. 
 Like you, I am generally an honest person. I don't cheat people in business.	I don't steal or commit crimes any worse than speeding on the freeway. I lie	all the time, but only when the lie is a helpful one, e.g.: ""Yes, you look great	in those parachute pants.""
 Like you, I play fair in sports, even against unfair opponents. I try to	be a gracious loser, and occasionally even a gracious winner.
 Like you, my family is the most important thing in my life. Preserving the	love, trust, and happiness in my family absolutely outweighs all other priorities	in my life.
 Like you, I have a clear sense of right and wrong. Generally, behavior that	injures someone else is wrong, and most of us (religious or not) avoid doing that whenever possible.
 Like you, if I see a complete stranger drop their wallet, I'll spring	into action like Batman to return it to them. It would never occur to either	you or I to keep it or expect a reward for returning it.
 If I see an elderly woman, I don't run over, punch her in the face and steal	her purse; and neither does a religious person. But note that no religious	person ever says ""I would love to punch out that old woman, but I can't	because the restrictions of my religion forbid it."" Nobody is going to do something like that,	because it's so obviously wrong. Rarely or never does any basically good person — and	that's most of us — need religious commandments to stop them from doing	something wrong.
 In summary, my Moral Center is essentially the same as yours. It comes from	the basic goodness of human nature, and my own sense of right and wrong that	is universally shared among all people. It does not stem from having read any	particular set of religious commandments, or from fear of punishment from a	deity. Since I formed this ethical system in the lack of a religious context,	how could my Moral Center be so similar to that of the average Christian or	Buddhist? I argue that everyone's basic Moral Center comes from human nature,	the nurture of societal interaction, and the sense of right and wrong. Since	everyone already has these things, the need to credit religion as an additional	source is redundant and thus wholly unnecessary.
 A common retort from religious people is that their particular God gave me those things: common	sense, and the ability to tell right from wrong. If that's so, and everyone	(atheists included) has been gifted with all the fundamentals needed to develop	a Moral Center, then we're still left at the same place. A religious upbringing	is still superfluous.
 Religion is an important and favored part of life for most people. Its practice	brings them satisfaction in many ways. But religion is absolutely not necessary	to become a good person, or to have a sound Moral Center. Philanthropists,	educators, doctors, and emergency workers have the same general	breakdown of religious affiliation (including no religion) as the population at	large, because they are the population at large.

New Age Energy,2,"October 11, 2006","An examination of energy, as new agers use the term.",Brian Dunning,Fads; General Science; Paranormal,"Dunning, B. ""New Age Energy."" Skeptoid Podcast. Skeptoid Media, 11 Oct 2006. Web. 3 Nov 2023. <https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4002>","I'm feeling a little low today, so let's tap into a source of energy	from a neighboring dimension as a quick upper.
 Faith in pseudoscience is rampant. Everywhere you turn, intelligent	people fully accept the existence of anything from psychic phenomena,	to angels, to new age healing techniques, to ancient health schemes	based on mysterious energy fields not understood by science. Most	of these paranormal phenomena rely on	""energy,"" and when the performers are asked to explain, they'll gladly	lecture about the body's energy fields, the universe's energy fields, Chi,	Prana, Orgone, negative energy, positive energy, and just about anything else	that needs a familiar sounding word to explain and justify it. Clearly, there	are too many loose interpretations of the word energy, to the point where most	people probably have no idea exactly what energy really is.
 I believe that if more people had a clear understanding of energy — and	it's not complicated — there would be less susceptibility to	pseudoscience, and more attention paid to actual technologies and	methods that are truly constructive and useful.
 A friend told me of her ability to perform minor healings, and	her best explanation was that she drew energy from another dimension.	She had recently rented What the Bleep Do We Know, so she was well	prepared to explain that alternate dimensions and realities should	be taken for granted, since science doesn't really know anything,	and thus those things cannot be disproven. That's fine, I'll concede	that she can make contact with another dimension: after all, the	latest M theories posit that there are probably ten or eleven of	them floating around, and I'll just hope that my friend's is not	one of those that are collapsed into impossibly small spaces. What	I was really interested in was the nature of this vaguely defined	energy that she could contact.
 I asked what type of energy is it, and how is it stored? Is it	heat? Is it a spinning flywheel? Is it an explosive compound? Is	it food? These are examples of actual ways that energy can be stored.
 In popular New Age culture, ""energy"" has somehow become	a noun unto itself.	""Energy"" is considered to be literally like a glowing, hovering,	shimmering cloud, from which adepts can draw power, and feel rejuvenated. Imagine	a vaporous creature from the original Star Trek series, and you'll have a good	idea of what New Agers think energy is.
 In fact, energy is not really a tangible ""thing"" at all. Energy is a measurement	of something's ability to perform work. Given this context, when	spiritualists talk about your body's energy fields, they're really	saying nothing that's even remotely meaningful. Yet this kind of	talk has become so pervasive in our society that the vast majority	of Americans accept that energy exists as a self-contained force,	floating around in glowing clouds, and can be commanded by spiritualist	adepts to do just about anything.
 There is well known authority for the simple, concrete, scientific	definition of energy. Take Einstein's equation, E=mc2,	that every schoolchild knows but so few spend the 30 seconds it takes	to understand. Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Speed is a function of distance and time, so energy can be expressed in mass, distance, and time. That's how we define work that can be done: actual, physical work. Energy is a measurement of work. If I lift a rock, I'm inputting	enough potential energy to dent the surface of the table one centimeter	when I drop it. The calories of chemical potential energy that my	bloodstream absorbs when I eat a Power Bar charge up my muscles enough	to dig 100kg of dirt in my garden. Nowhere did Einstein	discuss hovering glowing clouds, or fields of mystical power generated	by human spirits.
 When spiritualists discuss energy, don't blindly accept what they're	saying simply because energy is a word you're familiar with, and	that sounds scientific. In many cases, their usage of the word is	meaningless. When you hear the word energy casually used to explain a mystical force or capability,	require clarification. Require that the energy be defined. Is it heat? Is it	a spinning flywheel?
 Here's a good test. When you hear the word energy used	in a spiritual or paranormal sense, substitute the phrase ""measurable	work capability."" Does the usage still make sense? Are you actually	being given any information that supports the claim being made? Remember,	energy itself is not the thing being measured: energy is the measurement	of work performed or of potential.
 Take the following claim of Kundalini Yoga as an example:
 The		release and ascent of the dormant spiritual energy enables the aspirant		to transcend the effects of the elements and achieve consciousness.
This	would be a great thing if energy was indeed that shimmering cloud	that can go wherever it's needed and perform miracles. But it's not,	so in this case, we substitute the phrase	""measurable work capability"" and find that the sentence is not attempting	to measure or quantify anything other than the word energy itself.	We have a	""dormant spiritual measurable work capability,"" and no further information.	That's pretty vague, isn't it? For this claim to have any merit, they must	at least describe how this energy is being stored or manifested. Is it potential	energy stored in the chemistry of fat cells? Is it heat that can spread through	the body? Is it a measurable amount of electromagnetism, and if so, where's	the magnet? In any event, it must be measurable and precisely quantifiable,	or it can't be called energy, by definition.
There's a good reason why you don't hear medical doctors or pharmacists	talking about energy fields: it's meaningless. I think it's generally	good policy to remain open minded and be ready to hear claims that	involve energy, but approach them skeptically, and scientifically.	The next time you hear such a claim, substitute the phrase ""measurable	work capability"" and you'll be well equipped to separate the	silly from the solid.

Ethics of Peddling the Paranormal,3,"October 19, 2006",A proposal that it might be ethical for non-believers to sell paranormal services to the grieving in certain cases.,Brian Dunning,Alternative Medicine; Paranormal,"Dunning, B. ""Ethics of Peddling the Paranormal."" Skeptoid Podcast. Skeptoid Media, 19 Oct 2006. Web. 3 Nov 2023. <https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4003>","Today's we're going to re-examine a popular mantra among those who identify as being of a skeptical bent: the idea that anyone knowingly selling a worthless paranormal service is being unethical. It's an area where I've broken ranks with some of my colleagues and had to agree to disagree. And, obviously, we're not talking about cases where harm is done because there's no question that's unethical; but even that leads us into a gray area. So let's dive in and examine the ethics of peddling the paranormal. 
 In our society, people have the right to purchase things they want that are of no benefit, or even harmful. Cigarettes, alcohol, expensive cosmetic products containing questionable ingredients like ""extract of oleander"" — these are just a few examples. It's a free country, and most people want these things. We've decided, as a nation, that the preferences of a few should not curtail the freedoms of the many. We've decided as a nation that businesses selling paranormal services — from palm readers to homeopathy stores — have every right to exist. Many might raise convincing arguments that they're violating certain trade laws or defrauding customers, but the fact is that enough voters and lawmakers disagree, and where we are is where we are. Legally, these businesses are not being unethical, so long as they're causing no harm. But of course, ""legally unethical"" is not the entire spectrum, and still leaves plenty of room for consumers to be harmed.
Since these services legally have the right to exist, and since people are free to make their own choices about using them, customers are going to do so. These customers are believers who are going to buy these services: and if they don't buy them from the first shop, they're going to buy them from the second shop next door. So let's imagine an ethical skeptic who understands this reality, and hopes to come across an opportunity to do some good. He knows cold reading. He could be perfectly convincing and tell them exactly what they hope to hear for their money. In fact, the customer's experience will be identical to that they'd receive from the ""real"" psychic next door. This believing customer is going to be deceived, and no power on earth could convince that customer that he's being deceived. Add it all up, and we have a customer who insists on being deceived, and who has the right to purchase that deception. I believe that it's perfectly ethical — perhaps even beneficial — for our Ethical Skeptic to be the one selling that product.
 If you're like most people, you're disagreeing with me. You're probably saying that our Ethical Skeptic is being dishonest and lying to the customer, while the real psychic (though his powers are no more real than mine) is at least being honest. He's wrong, but he's honest. They're selling the same thing, and both giving the customer a satisfying experience. I see it just like a supermarket manager who allows cigarettes to be sold in his store. He knows they're a bad product, but people want them, and that's the way it is. Hate the game, not the player. Fixing the player isn't going to fix the game. In my proposal here, we've at least accomplished one thing: we've made the game a little bit safer, by having one of the options out there be a responsible, ethical skeptic who's never going to give harmful advice, and will sometimes be able to give good advice.
 The best argument I've heard against my position is that this takes away the customer's dignity, in removing his right to make a choice. Our Ethical Skeptic is being disingenuous, telling him that he's someone he's not, when the psychic competitor next door is being honest in claiming psychic powers. The customer chooses to go to a psychic. Ethical Skeptic is lying to him, while the psychic next door is not. I understand this argument, and I agree that it's true. But the reason this argument doesn't convince me is that it's irrelevant — the net result is exactly the same. The personal beliefs of the provider have no bearing on the transaction (just like the supermarket manager), and focusing on this question is ignoring the elephant in the room: the person wants to buy nonsense. The personal feelings or opinions of the person selling it are simply not part of the equation. Once the rubber meets the road, the seller's beliefs have no impact on the buyer's experience.
 Now, it's time to address the point that's probably foremost on your mind. What about the cases where the pseudoscience being purchased is either harmful, or takes the place of essential medical or psychiatric care? I said at the very beginning: This is about cases where no harm is done. And this is the vast majority of cases: Grandma thinks her poodle talks with her dead goldfish. What about the exceptions?
 Here's a hypothetical case where the customer really needs medical care: they have treatable cancer, but prefer to pay a psychic for New Age healing by the laying on of hands. Our Ethical Skeptic is neither completely stupid, nor irresponsible, nor in any particular need of blood money. In this case, he puts on his best New Age hat, and explains to this person in New Age terms that they'll understand and accept, that New Age healing can only help when applied alongside conventional cancer treatment. If we tell him New Age healing is bunk and he should go to the doctor, he'll write us off as a debunker and not listen, and go instead to the psychic next door. Here is where our Ethical Skeptic's New Age services are better — infinitely better — than those of the ""real"" psychic, who genuinely believes that laying on of hands should be used to the exclusion of real medicine.
 It's the same in cases where the customer needs psychiatric care. Let's say his mother died, and for some reason his grief has developed into real mental illness that's impacting his ability to live his life, and he wants to contact his dead mother. This is not someone who wants to predict tomorrow's horse race, this is someone who probably needs help beyond the Ethical Skeptic's abilities. In this case, Ethical Skeptic can dim the lights, hold as convincing a séance as he can, and tell the sufferer that his mother is worried about him and begs him to seek some professional help. If you tell him in this manner, he's likely to actually listen, and a qualified doctor can handle it from there. But if you take the usual skeptical path, and explain to him that talking to the dead is bunk and only a real doctor can help him, he won't listen, he'll go to the ""real"" psychic next door, and his problems will continue. Again, the Ethical Skeptic's services are good because they'll actually lead to a professional solution; the ""real"" psychic's services are bad, because they perpetuate the harm. This customer is not open to any solution that does not confirm his belief in psychics, and you have to understand that reality if you hope to actually help him. Yes, it's a lie to confirm his belief in the paranormal. But it's a white lie that helps.
 I argue that paranormal services are better provided by people who understand their limitations, rather than by those who believe they can do something they can't. Think how much better off believers would be if the paranormal services they received always led them to trained professionals in cases where such is needed.
 However, these cases are in the minority. Most of the time, people who buy paranormal products or services — be it goddess worshiping seminars, homeopathy, acupuncture, or psychic readings — are buying completely harmless services. It's not something I would do, because I want different things from my career. But  as long as the paranormal businesses are going to exist whether we like it or not, I hope to see even more Ethical Skeptics entering the business. Less harm would be done, and even if it's only every once in a while, people would be actually helped instead of merely tricked into thinking they were helped.",https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4003,were thinking tricked merely helped entering skeptics whether career different harmless buying readings acupuncture seminars worshiping goddess minority however professionals trained led always received rather limitations provided helps white psychics belief confirm perpetuate solution lead again continue problems won path usual handle qualified manner professional begs worried sufferer séance hold lights dim abilities beyond race horse tomorrow predict impacting illness mental developed grief died mother say medicine exclusion believes genuinely infinitely better instead listen debunker off write doctor bunk treatment conventional alongside applied terms explains hat puts blood irresponsible nor stupid completely hands laying pay prefer cancer treatable hypothetical exceptions goldfish dead talks poodle thinks grandma beginning very said care psychiatric essential purchased mind foremost address now buyer impact seller road meets rubber opinions feelings nonsense wants elephant ignoring focusing transaction bearing provider result net irrelevant true chooses claiming competitor him telling disingenuous choice removing dignity away position heard argument able sometimes advice give responsible options safer bit accomplished proposal fix fixing player game hate bad store sold allows manager supermarket satisfying giving mine powers though while lying dishonest disagreeing product beneficial perhaps deception insists add convince earth deceived believing real receive identical experience customer money perfectly reading cold he opportunity across come hopes reality understands skeptic door second shop first buy believers using choices harmed consumers room plenty leaves spectrum entire course causing long legally lawmakers voters customers defrauding laws trade certain violating arguments convincing raise might stores homeopathy readers palm services businesses freedoms curtail preferences nation decided country free oleander extract ingredients questionable containing products cosmetic expensive alcohol cigarettes harmful benefit purchase peddling dive gray leads question harm disagree agree colleagues ranks broken area service worthless selling knowingly anyone bent skeptical identify mantra examine such next talking medical reason least isn case go actually here used hear cases simply up enough done understand takes few knows every equation take majority vast saying fact think imagine power popular examples hope contact make doesn should best had really what exactly idea point needs just explain paranormal healing age new psychic accept pseudoscience let little will seek are part place at still needed tell ability things has argue could how ethical this since particular having among as from obviously something going because no does neither her never it into ll us someone right life thing most against even yes when only but time all on any business don honest much his who like probably would me you if lie these where see my unethical being re society can they so good own their both them help out want many person likely less one personal an for ve with once than more is people some by made either those same about wrong or there exist believe not do be beliefs your our live way ethics of that have to need and in the open we today
Rods: Flying Absurdities,4,"October 24, 2006","There is neither evidence nor plausible hypotheticals suggesting that invisible flying ""rods"" might exist.",Brian Dunning,Aliens & UFOs; Cryptozoology,"Dunning, B. ""Rods: Flying Absurdities."" Skeptoid Podcast. Skeptoid Media, 24 Oct 2006. Web. 3 Nov 2023. <https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4004>","From the cryptozoology files, we're going to look today at rods, those magical,	mystical living UFO's believed by some to inhabit the invisible shadowlands of Earth.
Rods are said to be flying creatures, from a few centimeters to a meter in length,	that are invisible to humans, but visible to cameras, both film and digital,	both still and video. Their bodies are shaped like long thin rods, and their	only appendages are wavy wings, one on each side, stretching the full length	of their bodies. They move through the air by undulating these wings, like	long, thin, aerial manta rays.
A	gentleman named Jose Escamilla claims to be the discoverer of rods. On his	website, Roswellrods.com, he says that he first captured rods on video in	1994. He says he was taping UFO's — an auspicious start to any report — when he accidentally filmed the rods as well.	Since Mr. Escamilla did not recall seeing any such thing in person while he	was taping, he decided the most likely explanation for his video is that he'd	discovered a new species of flying creature that is invisible to humans, and	only shows up on film or video. Since then, innumerable photographs and videos have surfaced that purport	to show rods. Search the Internet, and you'll find hundreds of them.
If rods are as ubiquitous as it would seem they are, why is their existence	not generally accepted? Justification for the existence of rods requires that	four basic claims be proven or at least shown to be reasonable:
 1. There should be zoological precedents for the existence of undiscovered		insects up to a meter in length. New species are being discovered all the		time, but few that are that size; nevertheless, it's possible, however unlikely. All they need to do to prove it is to produce one that can be examined.
2. We must accept the unprecedented existence of creatures that are invisible, although		they're up to a meter in length. Discounting		microscopic organisms, the natural world offers no better than transparency,		such as that found in some species of jellyfish. Transparency is not invisibility.		Supporters of rods have not proven that invisibility in the animal kingdom		is possible, and they will need to do so by presenting an invisible animal.
3. Certain images must be visible only in the output of all types of visible		wavelength cameras, but not visible to the naked eye. When cameras output		their images to the final medium, be it film, paper, or a video screen, we		see their output because our eyes see the same visible wavelengths that were		recorded and output. We're not talking about thermographic or other non-visible-wavelength		camera technologies here, so rod supporters will need to prove that all standard		cameras can convert certain invisible wavelengths into visible ones, without		affecting the visible wavelengths; which is something those cameras were		not designed to do. Only with this proof can it be reasonably accepted that		it's possible for a camera to see a solid object that was invisible to the photographer's eye.
4. Even if all of the above can be substantiated, there needs to be a lack		of a more likely explanation. If a simple procedure can be shown to easily		reproduce the appearance of rods on camera, then we haven't even established		that there is a phenomenon to be investigated.
As you might expect, there is indeed an alternate explanation, and a simple	procedure to take a picture showing rods. Imagine yourself standing with the	sun at your back, facing a large shaded area, such as the shaded entrance to	a cave. Dragonflies (or other insects) are flying everywhere, darting back	and forth at around 9 meters per second. Take a photograph, with a common shutter speed of 1/30th of a second.	In that time, the dragonfly will travel about 30 centimeters. Because your exposure	is set for the dark background, the path traced by the dragonfly's transit	will be overexposed and will appear solid white. Dragonflies beat their wings about 30 times a second, so the path described by its wingtip on your film image	would be one full sine wave period, 30 centimeters long. There would be one	of these sine waves down each side of the 30-centimeter-long rod shaped track	traced by the dragonfly's moving body. Change these parameters with different insects, different wing speeds, different camera shutter speeds, and you can duplicate any rod photograph on the Internet.
This phenomenon is so common that most any professional photographer can tell	you about being plagued by it while trying to take outdoor photographs or video	in similar lighting conditions. Nevertheless, the resulting image is strange	enough that someone not familiar with photography basics might conclude that	the subject in the photograph was in fact 30 centimeters long with undulating	wings, and the photographer would be absolutely correct in stating that he	did not see any 30-centimeter-long flying creatures with his naked eye.
The conclusion from all this is that rods are a well known, well established,	and well understood byproduct of photography. The proposed alternate explanation,	that they are an unknown and invisible lifeform only seen by cameras, requires	that some pretty outrageous claims about invisibility and photography be proven.	Until they are, or until a rod is captured and can be studied, I see no reason	to suspect that such things might exist. Always look for the alternate explanation that does not require dramatic new assumptions.",https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4004,assumptions dramatic suspect studied until outrageous seen lifeform unknown proposed byproduct conclusion stating correct subject conclude basics photography strange resulting conditions lighting outdoor trying plagued duplicate speeds wing parameters change moving track down waves period wave sine image wingtip described beat appear overexposed transit traced background dark exposure travel dragonfly 30th shutter photograph per meters forth darting dragonflies cave entrance shaded facing back sun standing showing picture investigated phenomenon established haven appearance reproduce easily procedure substantiated above photographer object reasonably proof designed affecting ones convert standard rod camera thermographic recorded wavelengths eyes screen paper medium final eye naked wavelength types output images presenting kingdom animal supporters invisibility jellyfish found transparency offers world natural organisms microscopic discounting although unprecedented examined produce prove unlikely nevertheless size insects undiscovered precedents zoological reasonable shown proven four requires justification accepted seem ubiquitous hundreds internet search show purport surfaced videos photographs innumerable shows discovered seeing recall mr filmed accidentally report start auspicious taping 1994 captured com roswellrods website discoverer escamilla jose named gentleman rays manta aerial undulating air move full stretching side each wings wavy appendages thin shaped bodies video digital film cameras visible humans length meter centimeters creatures flying shadowlands invisible inhabit believed ufo living magical rods files cryptozoology were different however always white path professional better said while earth he second first long certain might decided area solid such claims talking why reason through least must pretty indeed here require mystical did up centimeter enough speed times 30 few take simple known fact creature imagine which should alternate well was explanation technologies familiar needs body understood new existence accept everywhere will species are large its at still then tell things similar this since basic as from something going because says no does expect it into ll possible someone other absolutely thing most even look when only but time all on any his yourself like generally would you if these see being around re can they so their both find them person likely one without an for with than more lack is some by common those same about or there exist not do non be your our of set that have to need and in the we today

 To label your product or process as sustainable is to imply that competing	products and processes are not sustainable. What this is intended to mean is often pretty	vague. Presumably it means that competing products are manufactured from materials	that we'll run out of, should current methods and usage continue.
The word was  first	coined  to describe products or methods that are generally better	for the environment. Soon the marketing gurus got ahold	of the word, and now everything from toothpaste to music to real estate is	being sold as sustainable. Search Amazon for the word sustainable and prepare to be amazed by the diversity of products whose marketers have jumped onto this particular buzzword bandwagon.
 It's so effective, and thus popular, because it's become really just an alarmist term. Calling	your product sustainable is not really saying anything about your product;	it's clanging the warning bell about the alternative being unsustainable: Can't	be sustained! The world is ending! It's like calling your product ""hate	free"" or ""cruelty free"". In no way is it descriptive of your	product, it's simply an underhanded way to insult your competition. As any	marketing expert will tell you, people respond much better to a negative than	to a positive.
 One gross overusage of the term is ""sustainable agriculture"" when used by those selling organic crops — perhaps the word's single most common manifestation. Organic agriculture is certainly	sustainable, so long as a third of the world's population is willing to die	off so the rest of us can eat. As with many people who use the word sustainable, proponents of organic foods aren't really saying anything particular about	their product, they're trying to frighten you into thinking that modern 	farming practices will somehow destroy or deplete the environment, and are thus ""unsustainable"".	Ironically, the reverse is closer to the truth. Modern biotech crops require less fertilizer and less pesticide, many are drought tolerate and can get by with less water, and per-acre yields have skyrocketed. Organic — the so-called ""sustainable"" method — loses on all counts of resources consumed.
 The word organic is itself the same kind of deceptive marketing:	intended to trick you into thinking the alternative is somehow not organic.	Strictly speaking, all plants and animals are organic, according to the word's	true definition. It's another great example of the same basic lesson: When you hear any product defined only by a vague buzzword,	especially one that's grossly overused, be skeptical.
 The word sustainable has become so pervasive that its usage is often just	plain silly. Colgate recently purchased a company that makes sustainable toothpaste.	It contains bone powder. Does an intelligent person really think that it's	unsustainable to make toothpaste any other way?
 Sustainable tourism is being marketed everywhere. It usually describes destinations	where the attractions are generally undeveloped, like the Amazon. It is really	unsustainable to vacation in developed destinations like Paris or Tokyo? Certainly a cogent argument could be formed saying that it's best to shield the undeveloped areas from the impact of tourism.
 Sustainable economics are particularly bizarre. Google the term, and you'll	find that it's used largely to refer to wealth redistribution. In the history of world economies, has communism	really proven to be more sustainable than capitalism? There may be fine arguments to make in favor of wealth redistribution, but that such a system should be expected to survive longer is certainly not the case.
 A prominent automotive magazine recently tested four ""sustainable sport	sedans"". Are four cars that get marginally better gas mileage than other	similar cars	— none of which are particularly great — honestly the only type	of vehicles whose production can be sustained? Eventually all our cars will run on fuel that truly is sourced in an infinitely sustainable way; but until we get there, it's disingenuous to say some current cars are sustainable and others aren't.
 Sustainable music is also all over the Internet. In one case, it means the	guy makes his own instruments. Is sustainable really the word that	best describes that? Playing an instrument someone else made is not sustainable?	In other cases, it refers to songs about anticorporatism. Is it truly impossible	to sustain the playing of music about other themes? These may all be fine subjects, but they should be recognized on their merits, not for their association with a buzzword.
 I found a website offering sustainable real estate. Two of the houses were	built of corn cobs and hay bales. I'll ask the	Big Bad Wolf how sustainable that type of engineering is.
There's no doubt that doing things in a truly sustainable way is good. Accomplishing	a worthy goal in a way that's infinitely repeatable is best, and that's what sustainable really means. True sustainability might violate the laws of thermodynamics,	but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. It's still a good goal, and	as such, sustainability deserves not to be diluted into a meaningless buzzword.	Thus, true environmentalists should be the first ones to object to the misleading	pop-culture usages of the word that we see every two minutes. When you hear it,	be skeptical. Figure out what they're really trying to say, and what their	motivation is. And please don't buy any bone-powder toothpaste just	because it says sustainable on the package.
